-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Please place your code for your team in the folder week5.                                |
|Remember to introduce a readme file and PLEASE DON'T ERASE THE CODE of your partners :)  |
|The deadline for the final project is FRIDAY.                                            |

Thank you so much to be in this lightning course.
I hope you enjoy it and learn a bit more from c++.

I know there wasn't enough time and that 30 hrs is not enough. 
But thanks for the feedback.

Enjoy the next week. I'll start sending the grades the next week so any question or doubt.
Send me an e-mail

Final Project
======================================================
1- Select a problem to solve to create a useful application. e.g 
     a- A security system using some embedded system like arduino, and by pass that information
         to a desktop application. 
     b- A voice detector or object detection. 
  
Requisites of the app 
      The application must be separated in the following structure. 

      [Libraries            ]       = Third party or own libraries     (C++) 
      [Business Core  ]       = Logic part of your application (C++)
      [User experience]      = Graphical user interface        (Python, Perl, Ruby) + (GTK, Qt, etc)
      [Installer/Uninstaller]  = A proper way to handle and install your software with all the dependencies (Bash, Python, Perl) 

Select your target OS
       Windows
       Linux 
       OS X
