Rodents (Latin rodere, to gnaw) are mammals of the order Rodentia, characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About forty percent of all mammal species are rodents, and they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and can be found in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. There are species that are arboreal, fossorial (burrowing), and semi-aquatic. Well known rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, prairie dogs, porcupines, beavers, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Other animals such as rabbits, hares and pikas, which could be confused with rodents, were once included with them, but are now considered to be in a separate order, Lagomorpha.
