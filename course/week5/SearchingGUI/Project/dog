The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is a canid that is known as man's best friend. The dog was the first domesticated animal[2][3] and has been widely kept as a working, hunting, and pet companion. According to recent coarse estimates, there are currently between 700 million and one billion dogs, making them the most abundant member of order Carnivora in the world.
