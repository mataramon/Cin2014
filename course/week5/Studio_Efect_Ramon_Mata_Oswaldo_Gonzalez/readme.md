#Description

Studio Effect is a Windows application that allow to add sound effects to a WAV PCM mono file. Three effects are implemented in this version, Echo, Reverse Plaback and a Simple Tremolo.

#Notes
    - Installer Path:
        ..\Studio_Efect\Setup\Setup\Express\DVD-5\DiskImages\DISK1
    - Execute Setup.exe
    - We've included a precompiled working version in case of Installer failure in:
        ..\Studio_Efect\Debug

#TODO's

    - Need to improve effect quality
    - Support for stereo
    - Installer acts weird in some windows installations
    - MinGW and Visual Studio compiler can show unexpected errors on 32-Bit platforms

#Motivation

C++ Class Final Project
